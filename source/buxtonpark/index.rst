Buxton Park 
===========

The beautiful and flourishing **Buxton Park** is located on Simpson College's campus and is in the heart of Indianola. It is a popular spot for dog-walkers, joggers, and even a family (or solo!) leisurely stroll. Occassionally, photography sessions and weddings can be held amongst the colorful gardens. 

A part of the park was donated to the city of Indianola by the Buxton family, hence the park's name, in 1906. This was the city's first public park.

Structures
----------
The park contains a variety of structures and pathways in addition to all the foliage. The **gazebo** is a popular place for weddings and as a resting place, since it has spaced-out benches around the interior. Near the gazebo are two formal displays of flowers: the *Formal Annual Display* and the *Formal Garden*. In the middle of the **Formal Annual Display** is a large and pretty fountain, named the **Memorial Fountain**. The fountain is surrounded by flowers, presumably to keep children and animals from playing in the fountain. 

Near the **Information Center**, which is close to the gazebo, there is a pathway through the *Rose Gardens* which will lead you to the **Memorial Garden**, a garden with shiny slabs engraved with names of those in memorium. Next to the garden is the **Butterfly Gardens**, a great place to see some butterflies in the springtime, especially monarchs and swallowtails.

On the other side of the park, there is a pathway called **Crabapple Mall**, a strip of trees and flowers that lead to two benches and wooden arbors. In addition, there is a recently-added playground called **The Children's Garden** for children to play in and explore. 

Park Scavenger Hunt
-------------------
The City of Indianola has a scavenger hunt sheet for anyone who would like it, although it is namely used for children to explore nature.
