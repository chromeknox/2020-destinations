**Lake Ahquabi** is a state park located near Indianola, Iowa. The word "ahquabi" originates from the Native American tribes *Sauk* and *Fox* and means "resting place". The park was dedicated to political cartoonist and conservationist J.N. "Ding" Darling in 1936. 

The park in total is about 770 acres and is located about 6 miles from Indianola.

Facilities & Campsites
""""""""""""""""""""""
Many of the facilities or other man-made structures were built in the era of the Great Depression (1930s) by the Civilian Conservation Corps. There are three open shelters that are open to the public for picnics and are able to be reserved for large gatherings. 

There is also the stone lodge that has a great view of the lake. It is a popular rental place for reunions, weddings, and graduation parties. 

There is one campground that contains a number of smaller campsites within. The campground is located close to the shore of Lake Ahquabi. Near the campsites are electrical hookup stations, up-to-date restrooms (and showers), along with two dump stations for trailers and campers. Each designated campsite contains a firepit/fireplace and a picnic table. There is a playground located close by for the children to play on.

Any facilites can be rented through the `park reservation system <https://iowastateparks.reserveamerica.com//>`_.
