**Exhibits**

*Union Jack Balloon*

This famous balloon is a step back in time. This balloon was manufactured in the 1970's.
Fun fact, the registration number, N75GB, is in honor of the 25th anniversary of Queen 
Elizabeth II's coronation. 

*Channel Champ*

This hot air balloon has been all across the world. From England, to France, and now 
our museum.
Our channel champ is a historical balloon that will forever be recognized as important. 
You can learn more about the Pilots of Channel Champ in our theater. 


*Hot Air Airship*

The hot air airship is a hot air balloon that has a look that will knock your socks off!
It's colored red and has Saint Louis written on its side. 
It has a speed that can go up to 15 mph and a lot of complex features! It's even more 
impressive when you see it in flight. 

*Women Balloonists*

Additionally, we have an exhibit dedicated to important women balloonists. Some notable 
figures include pilots, crew members and chiefs, observers, and engineers. Without these
women, the history of ballooning would be nothing.
